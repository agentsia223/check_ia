# Check-IA Project Charter

## Vision

Check-IA aspires to become the leading open-source fact-checking platform for French-speaking Africa, empowering citizens across the Sahel region and beyond to identify and combat misinformation through accessible, AI-driven verification tools.

## Mission

Check-IA achieves its vision by:

- **Combining multiple AI models** (NLP classification, large language models, and computer vision) to provide thorough, multi-layered verification of text claims and images
- **Designing for cultural and linguistic context**, ensuring that analysis accounts for the realities of French-speaking African communities
- **Prioritizing accessibility**, with a simple interface that delivers clear, sourced verdicts understandable by the general public
- **Operating transparently** as an open-source project, allowing anyone to inspect, improve, and deploy the platform

## Community Statement

The Check-IA community is built on the following values:

- **Inclusivity** — We welcome contributors from all backgrounds, with a particular focus on amplifying voices from the Sahel region and French-speaking Africa
- **Transparency** — Our code, processes, and decision-making are open for public review
- **Respect** — We treat every community member with dignity, recognizing the diverse cultural contexts of our users and contributors
- **Collaboration** — We believe the best solutions come from working together across disciplines, geographies, and perspectives
- **Accuracy** — We are committed to building tools that help people find the truth, and we hold ourselves to the same standard

All participants in the Check-IA community are expected to abide by our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

## Licensing Strategy

Check-IA is licensed under the **Apache License 2.0** ([full text](LICENSE)).

This license was chosen because:

- **Patent protection** — Apache 2.0 includes an explicit patent grant from contributors, protecting users and downstream developers from patent claims
- **Broad compatibility** — Apache 2.0 is compatible with most other open-source licenses, including GPLv3, making it easy for others to integrate Check-IA into their projects
- **Clear contribution terms** — Contributors retain copyright to their work while granting a perpetual, irrevocable license to the project and its users
- **Trademark clarity** — The license explicitly addresses trademark usage, which is important for protecting the Check-IA brand

Contributors agree that any contributions submitted to the project are made under the terms of the Apache License 2.0, unless explicitly stated otherwise.

## Key Trademarks

The following are trademarks of the Check-IA project:

- **"Check-IA"** — The project name

- **check-ia.app** — The project's domain name

These trademarks may not be used in derivative works, forks, or third-party products without prior written permission from the project maintainers, except as required by the Apache License 2.0 for describing the origin of the work. This ensures that users can trust that products bearing the Check-IA name meet the project's standards for quality and accuracy.
