# Code of Conduct Incident Response Guide

This document outlines the internal process for handling Code of Conduct reports for the Check-IA project.

## Receiving Reports

- Reports are submitted via email to **hello@check-ia.app**
- All reports are treated as confidential
- Acknowledge receipt within **48 hours**
- Do not discuss reports publicly or with uninvolved parties

## Assessment Process

### Who Reviews Reports

Reports are reviewed by the project maintainers. If a maintainer is the subject of a report, they must recuse themselves from the review process.

### Conflict of Interest

Any reviewer with a personal or professional relationship to the parties involved must disclose this and recuse themselves if it could affect impartiality.

### Timeline

- **48 hours**: Acknowledge receipt to the reporter
- **7 days**: Complete initial assessment and determine action
- **14 days**: Communicate the outcome to all involved parties

## Response Actions

Responses follow the enforcement guidelines in [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md):

| Level | Action | When Applied |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Private written warning** | First-time minor violations |
| 2 | **Public warning** | Repeated minor violations or a single moderate violation |
| 3 | **Temporary ban** | Serious violations or sustained pattern of minor violations |
| 4 | **Permanent ban** | Severe violations or continued behavior after temporary ban |

## Documentation

- All incidents are logged in a private, access-controlled document
- Logs include: date, summary, parties involved, action taken, and reviewer(s)
- Personal identifying information is stored securely and shared only with reviewers
- An anonymized annual summary may be published for community transparency

## Communication

### To the Reporter

- Confirm that the report was received
- Provide updates on the review timeline
- Communicate the final decision and action taken

### To the Person Reported

## Appeals
